My solution to the calculator app challenge from Frontend Mentor.

HTML, CSS, and JS to create a functioning simple calculator.
Bonus challenge completed! (storing the theme preference in local storage.)

If an operation button is clicked after equals, the previous result is used. If a number is pressed, the previous result is deleted. Reset button resets calculator. Screen is a textarea, allowing for user to input via keyboard.
